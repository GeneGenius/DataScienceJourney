From nobody Tue Apr 11 08:39:19 2017 Content-Type: text/html; \\tcharset=\"iso-8859-1\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit  <body lang=EN-US>  <div class=Section1>   <p class=MsoBodyText style=\\'text-align:justify\\'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being bombarded by so-called “FREE” money-making systems that teases you with limited information, and when it’s all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>! Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I don’t regret at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>  <p class=MsoBodyText style=\\'text-align:justify\\'><b>This system is quite simply the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that I’ve seen before. Why? Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously consider if this is right for you.\\xa0 No teasing. No grand testimonies! No kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you “no idea” of their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you with the two things you really must know: “<u>What’s it all about</u>?” and “<u>How does it work</u>?”. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you don’t want to do that; by then you are “hooked” and now locked into a frustrating battle to try to get your money back! </b></p>  <p class=MsoBodyText style=\\'text-align:justify\\'>I call this my “Platinum Choice” because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally different from previously misleading, “hook-first” programs that promise lofty mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own pockets! You’ve seen the headlines: “<u>Join free and Make $10,000 every week for life</u>” yeah, right!</p>  <p class=MsoBodyText style=\\'text-align:justify\\'>I did not make millions yet, but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldn’t be able to do anything without corporate help – which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p>  <p class=MsoBodyText style=\\'text-align:justify\\'>You have to see this in action for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and the Internet’s explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free corporate help, on-time member’s support and even protective safeguards! </p>  <p class=MsoBodyText style=\\'text-align:justify\\'>Get it now, and you can call me at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free.\\xa0 Good luck!</p>  <p class=MsoBodyText style=\\'text-align:justify\\'><a href=\"http://www.mindupmerchants.com/default.asp?ID=5581\">http://www.mindupmerchants.com/default.asp?ID=5581</a></p>  <p class=MsoBodyText style=\\'text-align:justify\\'>Ben Green, (775) 322-3323 </p>  <p class=MsoBodyText>P.S.Free POP3 email is ofered for members now!</p> </div>  </body>'),\n",

Bonding is not suitable for you because it works too low-level (it is=20 layer 2), unless you have two links from the same provider, using some=20 technology that can be bonded (like ADSL).
